# 🧠 QA Mindmaps

This section showcases my approach to **visual test design using mindmaps**, which helps in identifying test scenarios, dependencies, and risks early in the testing process. Mindmaps are especially effective during requirement analysis and test planning phases.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of Mindmaps

Mindmaps are used to:
- Understand application flow quickly
- Identify functional and non-functional test scenarios
- Improve test coverage through visual exploration
- Detect gaps, edge cases, and dependencies early

---

## 📌 What This Section Includes

- Feature-level test mindmaps
- End-to-end workflow mindmaps
- Regression coverage mindmaps
- Risk-based testing mindmaps
